# future-proofing-cities-frontend
## Description

This is a web app that was created using streamlit and shows the heat distribution in Paris and Berlin.
The web gets the data via API.
The scaler on the map is going from blue to red and the intensity of red color shows the heat strength of the tile.
Heat islands are mainly distributed in the center of the cities.
All backend works have been done in the repository: https://github.com/b-fa-ce/future_proofing_cities
